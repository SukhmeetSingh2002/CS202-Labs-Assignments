# Assumptions:
- In `Task3`, the capital letter word has to be in between the word (as mentioned in question). If there are only two letters in the word then it will not count it.
- In `Task4`, the two words can be separated any character except hyphen and apostrophe and have to in same line(as mentioned in question).
- For `RegexTime` , both `09.50 am` and `9.50 am` are asummed to be correct.

In all tasks a word can have characters matched by `\w`.
# How to run:

For Task 1 to 5 run
